    <p> Collection Old or damaged computing devices like desktops, laptops, tablets, printers, and servers are collected from homes, offices, schools, etc.
Collection can be done through e-waste bins, special drives, drop-off centers, or pick-up services.
This step ensures electronic waste does not end up in landfills.
Collection programs can be run by governments, NGOs, or private companies.
Some companies offer exchange or cashback offers to encourage returns.
Proper collection reduces illegal dumping and promotes responsible recycling
